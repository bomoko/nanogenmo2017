# nanogenmo2017

Not much to this - November is a pretty busy time, but I wanted to try _something_ for this year's NanoGenMo.
So I dumped a bunch of my stories into a text file, used Rita.js to generate some text, and spat out a novel.

Move along ...

(note: the source text isn't included since the biggest chunk of it was an unpublished, trunked, novel that I don't want out in the world)
